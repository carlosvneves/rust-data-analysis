# Rust EDA

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks, all powered by a Rust kernel. With these notebooks, you'll be able to dive deep into the realm of data analysis with Rust, exploring different datasets and extracting insights with ease using different Rust libraries such as ndarray, plotters, and much more.

## Steps

- Install rust toolchain:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain nightly
```

- Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).

- Install `evcxr_jupyter`

```sh
cargo install evcxr_jupyter
evcxr_jupyter --install
```

- Run the notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Make sure you have the rust kernel selected from the top right corner of the kernel. You should see the official Rust logo.
